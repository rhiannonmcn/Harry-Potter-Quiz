## Site Structure

Harry Potter Online Quiz consists of a one page site with 5 different 'screens' and an optional 6th screen, that the user navigates through to engage with the quiz. The Home screen offers two navigation paths, one to enter the quiz and another to see the highscores. Each screen has an information bar with information and controls on it; the home page button is to the immediate left and the sound icon toggles the sound on and off is right beside it. When the user progresses to the actual quiz, the bar is filled with a timer, counting down how long the user has to answer the questions and a score which tallies the user's score as they progress through the quiz. Upon finishing the quiz you the user is immediately taken to the results screen that gives the option to navigate to the optional 6th screen which is the highscores screen which can also be accessed from the home screen or to go to the home page.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The final colour scheme chosen was a rich dark red colour, with a warm, cream colour for the text and a mid grey colour as an accent. This colour scheme directly links back with the theme of the project: Harry Potter. Red is often associated with Harry Potter, the main character, because of his association with the Gryffindor house, who's colour is red or scarlet. The grey and cream colours are a nod to the main setting of the books, which is a castle, and the magical community's main ways of communication which tends to be a bit old fashioned in it's use of parchment and quills.

### Typography

The fonts chosen were Cinzel for the main heading text and Prata for the subsequent heading and body text. Sans-serif is the fallback font. 

Both fonts are a serif font and tie nicely with the theme of the quiz. There is a slight vintage feel to both fonts, with the use of letter spacing to give it a clean feel.

# Features

The Harry Potter Online Book Quiz is created to produce an immersive experience for the user through the use of both design and site structure. It moves away from a typical website structure with the a menubar and is structured and designed more like a game.

It is intuitively designed so the user can navigate it with ease, with visible and recognisable Home and Sound button icons, and visual ques and sound effects reflecting the topic.

## Navigation

* The site navigation is done through the info bar at the top of the game area.
* This does not change in style throughout the user's navigation of the quiz.
* The home button is an icon of a castle, a nod to the theme itself while still being recognisable as a 'home' button. 
* The position of the Home button does not move throughout the user's navigation of the quiz.
* The sound button is automatically muted on website loading and like the home button it's position doesn't move.
* On the quiz run through two more bits of information are added to the right of these: the timer countdown and the user's score.
* The navbar is responsive and does not change order throughout screen size changes.
