## Site Structure

Harry Potter Online Quiz consists of a one page website with 4 different 'screens' that the user navigates to engage with the quiz. The difficulty page of the quiz is the default 'screen'. Each screen has an information bar with information and controls on it; the home page button is to the immediate left and the sound icon toggles the sound on and off is right beside it. When the user progresses to the actual quiz, the bar is filled with the number question they are on, out of the number of questions there are, a timer, counting down how long the user has to answer the questions and a score which tallies the user's point as they progress through the quiz.

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The final colour scheme chosen was a rich dark red colour, with a warm, cream colour for the text and a mid grey colour as an accent. This colour scheme directly links back with the theme of the project: Harry Potter. Red is often associated with Harry Potter, the main character, because of his association with the Gryffindor house, who's colour is red or scarlet. The grey and cream colours are a nod to the main setting of the books, which is a castle, and the magical communitys main ways of communication which tends to be a bit old fashioned in it's use of parchment and quills.

### Typography

The fonts chosen were Cinzel for the main heading text and Prata for the subsequent heading and body text. Sans-serif is the fallback font. 

Both fonts are a serif font and tie nicely with the theme of the quiz. There is a slight vintage feel to both fonts, with the use of letter spacing to give it a clean feel.,
